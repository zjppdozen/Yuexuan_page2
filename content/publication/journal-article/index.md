  Background: Variation in preclinical cognitive decline suggests additional
  genetic factors related to Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., a non-APOE polygenic
  risk scores [PRS]) may interact with the APOE ε4 allele to influence cognitive
  decline. 


  Methods: We tested the PRSAPOE ε4age interaction on preclinical cognition using longitudinal data from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention. All analyses were fitted using a linear mixed-effects model and adjusted for within individual/family correlation among 1,190 individuals. 


  Results: We found statistically significant PRSAPOE ε4age interactions on immediate learning (P=0.038), delayed recall (P<0.01), and Preclinical Alzheimer’s Cognitive Composite 3 score (P=0.026). PRS-related differences in overall and memory-related cognitive domains between people with and without APOE ε4 emerge after age 70, with a much stronger adverse PRS effect among APOE ε4 carriers. The findings were replicated in a population-based cohort.


  Conclusion: APOE ε4 can modify the association between PRS and cognition decline.
