Yuexuan Xu, MPP, is a Ph.D. candidate (genetic epidemiologist in training) from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. His major is population health sciences (previously called <em><strong> preventive medicine and community health) and his minor is Statistics, Quantitative Genetics, and Genetic Epidemiology. He received systematic training in policy analysis, health economics, statistical genetics, data science, and epidemiology methods in the past several years. Specifically, he got his bachelor degree in public administration from Shandong University in Jinan, China, and his master of public policy (MPP) from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California. In addition, He received training in genome-wide data analysis and received a certificate from Tinbergen Institute in the Netherlands. His research interests include:

Social science genetics, aging and cognition, the interaction between socioeconomic factors, modifiable risk factors, and genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, public policy (especially effective health policy to control for Alzheimer's disease epidemic), and statistical/quantitative genetics.

He is currently working with Professors [Corinne Engelman](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/staff/engelman-corinne/) and [Jason Fletcher](https://lafollette.wisc.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/jason-fletcher) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison to explore the relationship between social/genetic determinants and multiple health and social outcomes. Previously, he was a research assistant to Professor [Titus Galama](https://cesr.usc.edu/people/staff/galama) at the University of Southern California/Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Professor [Junyu Niu](https://blogs.worldbank.org/team/junyu-niu) at Fudan University. He also worked as a teaching assistant with Professor [John Romley](https://priceschool.usc.edu/people/john-a-romley/) at the University of Southern California.
