I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Engelman](https://med.stanford.edu/snyderlab.html)'s Laboratory, Department of Population Health Sciences, School of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My work focuses on integrating genetic and environmental factors, as well as the latest epidemiological and precision health technologies, into the study of complex diseases, for example, Alzheimer's disease.

My dissertation demonstrated the effects of the currently known common non-*APOE* genetic variants are more detrimental among *APOE* *ε*4 carriers than non-carriers. I also identified a pattern on how early life to mid-to-late life social and physical environment can modify the genetic predisposition of Alzheimer's on later life cognition decline during the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's. At UW-Madison, I worked on a wide range of epidemiological studies, with Professor Corinne Engelman and Jason Fletcher, including pathway-specific polygenic risk scores for cognition and biomarkers of neurodegeneration, applying life-course and social epidemiology techniques in gene-environment interactions, gene-gene interactions in Alzheimer's, integrating rare variants into the common-variants based polygenic risk score, and using the instrumental variable approach to understand the relationship between early life exposure to pneumonia morbidity and mortality, genetics, and cognition in older life.
